# Project 0x10: HTTPS SSL

## Concepts

### DNS
DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. It helps in locating and identifying devices on a network.

### Web Stack Debugging
Web stack debugging involves troubleshooting and fixing issues within the components of a web stack, such as the web server, database, and application server.

## Background Context

Securing website traffic is crucial for protecting sensitive information transmitted between users and the server. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a protocol that encrypts the data exchanged between a user's web browser and the server. It ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the information.
