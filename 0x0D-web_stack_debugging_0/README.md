# Web Stack Debugging #0

## Project Description

The **Web Stack Debugging series** is designed to hone the skills of individuals in the art of debugging, a crucial skill for Full-Stack Software Engineers. The project involves addressing broken or buggy web stacks by creating a Bash script. This script, when executed, should rectify the issues and restore the web stack to a functional state. Before scripting, participants need to engage in manual debugging to comprehend and resolve the underlying problems.

## Project Goals

1. Develop proficiency in debugging web stacks.
2. Create a Bash script capable of fixing broken or buggy web stacks.
3. Execute manual debugging to identify and understand the issues.
4. Achieve a working state for the web stack using the Bash script.
