# 0x0B. SSH DevOps Project

## Author
Sylvain Kalache

## Overview
This project involves setting up and configuring SSH on an Ubuntu server, emphasizing the use of RSA key pairs for secure authentication. The project is part of the learning objectives in the field of DevOps, covering topics related to SSH, networking, system administration, and security.

## Project Details
- Weight: 1
- Project Start: Jan 19, 2024 6:00 AM
- Project End: Jan 22, 2024 6:00 AM
- Checker Released: Jan 20, 2024 12:00 AM
- Auto Review Deadline: Jan 22, 2024 (at the project end)

## Background Context
You've been assigned an Ubuntu server located in a distant datacenter. Access to the server will be through SSH using an RSA key instead of a password. Server information, including IP and username, is available in the "my servers" section of the intranet.

Note: The server is configured with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
1. What is a server
2. Where servers usually live
3. What is SSH
4. How to create an SSH RSA key pair
5. How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
6. The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`
