## Concepts

### Regular Expression

#### Background Context

In this project, participants are required to construct regular expressions using the Oniguruma library, which is the default regular expression library for Ruby. It's essential to note that different libraries may have distinct properties, so using Oniguruma is crucial for this exercise.

Here is the Ruby code template:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts ARGV[0].scan(/127.0.0.[0-9]/).join
