## Concepts
### What is a Child Process?
In this project, understanding the concept of a child process is crucial.

## Background Context
In this project, tasks will be graded on two aspects:
1. Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements?
2. Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine without any human intervention?

Example Bash script in the answer file:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Configuring a server with specification XYZ
echo hello world > /tmp/test
sed -i 's/80/8080/g' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

# Web Server Configuration Project

## Introduction
This project aims to configure a web server (web-01) according to specified requirements. The checker will execute your scripts as the root user, eliminating the need for the sudo command.

## Tips for Testing
To test your Bash script, reproduce the checker environment:
1. Start a Ubuntu 16.04 sandbox.
2. Run your script on it.
3. Observe its behavior.
