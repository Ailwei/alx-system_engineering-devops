# 0x0A. Configuration Management

## Project Overview

This project focuses on configuration management using Puppet. The goal is to create Puppet manifests for managing infrastructure, automating tasks, and ensuring the reliability of systems.

### Background Context

During my time at SlideShare, I encountered a critical incident related to an auto-remediation tool called Skynet. The incident involved the unintended shutdown of a significant portion of infrastructure due to a bug. Puppet played a crucial role in restoring the infrastructure promptly, highlighting the importance of configuration management.
