# Networking Basics Project

## Overview
This project is focused on understanding fundamental networking concepts and protocols, emphasizing the OSI model, LAN, WAN, Internet, IP addresses, TCP/UDP, ports, ping/ICMP, and related tools. The goal is to create Bash scripts and documentation to explain these concepts without relying on external sources.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following topics:
- OSI Model
- LAN and WAN
- Internet
- IP Address (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Localhost and Subnet
- TCP and UDP
- Ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
- Ping/ICMP
- Positional parameters for tools like netstat and ping

## Project Structure
The project is organized into individual Bash scripts, each focusing on a specific topic. The following is an overview of the project structure:

1. **OSI Model (`osi_model.sh`):**
   - Script: Displays information about each layer of the OSI model.
   - Documentation: Explains the purpose and functionality of each OSI layer.

2. **LAN and WAN (`lan_wan.sh`):**
   - LAN:
     - Script: Describes common uses of LANs and displays the typical size.
     - Documentation: Explains LAN usage and geographical size.
   - WAN:
     - Script: Describes common uses of WANs and displays the typical size.
     - Documentation: Explains WAN usage and geographical size.

3. **Internet (`internet.sh`):**
   - Script: Provides information about the Internet and its role in networking.
   - Documentation: Explains how the Internet works and its significance.

4. **IP Address (`ip_address.sh`):**
   - Script: Displays the IP address of the machine.
   - Documentation: Explains the purpose of IP addresses and the difference between IPv4 and IPv6.

5. **Localhost and Subnet (`localhost_subnet.sh`):**
   - Localhost:
     - Script: Describes what localhost is.
   - Subnet:
     - Script: Describes the concept of subnets.

6. **TCP/UDP (`tcp_udp.sh`):**
   - Script: Explains TCP and UDP and their main differences.
   - Documentation: Highlights key differences between TCP and UDP.

7. **Ports (`ports.sh`):**
   - Script: Displays the concept of ports and memorizes SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers.

8. **Ping/ICMP (`ping_icmp.sh`):**
   - Script: Demonstrates the use of ping and ICMP to check if a device is connected.

9. **Positional Parameters (`positional_parameters.sh`):**
   - Scripts: Utilizes positional parameters with netstat and ping.

10. **Documentation (`README.md`):**
    - Explains the purpose of each script.
    - Provides instructions on running the scripts.
    - Includes additional information on networking concepts.

## Usage
Ensure that all Bash scripts are executable using `chmod +x script_name.sh`. Execute each script individually to explore and understand the associated networking concept.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Bash scripts must pass ShellCheck without any errors
- Follow script structure and comments as specified in the project requirements
- Avoid plagiarism and create original content

## Notes
- Test scripts thoroughly to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Verify the project against the requirements before submission.
- Any questions or issues can be addressed through the project discussion forum.
